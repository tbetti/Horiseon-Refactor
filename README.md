Using the original code, I changed all the <div> HTML tags to semantic tags.  I also created alternate attributes for the images and I created a descriptive title for the webpage.  I ensured all links were working properly.  I added comments to the html and css files.  Finally, I rearranged some of the CSS selectors and properties so they followed a the structure of the HTML.
